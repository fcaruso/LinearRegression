# Linear Regression using gradient descent
Implementation of the gradient descent to solve [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) problems, 
i.e. try to describe (approximate) a system using a linear model of the form X*theta = Y.
- X matrix is the independent variable
- Y matrix is the dependent variable 
- theta are the parameters estimated by minimizing the mean square error of the training dataset using the [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) technique.
